        <b>Process and Creative Choices:</b>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Visual Appeal:
                <br>
                I maintained a clean and visually appealing design for the game interface. The choice buttons
                and images are appropriately styled to enhance the overall user experience.
            </li>
            <li>
                Video Background:
                <br>I added a video background using the `<\video>` element to create an immersive atmosphere for
                    the adventure game. This adds a dynamic element to the webpage and aligns with the theme of exploring
                    different kingdoms.
            </li>
            <li>
                Responsive Design: 
                <br>
                The layout is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across
            different devices. The `max-width` property in the CSS for the `main` element ensures that the content
            doesn't stretch too wide on larger screens.
            </li>
            <li>
                Color Scheme:
                <br>
                 I chose a color scheme that complements the adventurous theme, with a background color that
            doesn't distract from the main content and buttons that stand out for user interaction.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <b>Challenges Faced and Solutions:</b>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Dynamic Content:
                <br>The challenge was to dynamically update the content based on user choices. I overcame
            this by utilizing JavaScript to manipulate the DOM, updating text and images as the user progresses through
            the story.
            </li>
            <li>
                Video Autoplay:
                <br>
                Autoplaying a video with muted sound and looping seamlessly required careful
            implementation. The `autoplay`, `muted`, and `loop` attributes in the `<\video>` element, along with proper
            file format (`video/mp4`), ensure a smooth video experience.
            </li>
            <li>
                Image Loading:
                <br> Loading images dynamically based on the user's choices required proper handling. I
            incorporated the `image` property in the story object and updated the `src` attribute of the image
            element accordingly.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <b>Insights Gained:</b>
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                User Engagement:
                <br>
                Integrating dynamic choices enhances user engagement. Players feel more involved as
            they make decisions that impact the story progression.
            </li>
            <li>
                Story Flow:
                <br> Ensuring a logical flow in the storytelling is crucial. Clear connections between choices
            and consequences maintain coherence and keep the player immersed in the narrative.
            </li>
            <li>
                Testing Iterations:
                <br>
                During the development process, frequent testing was crucial. It allowed me to
            identify and address any issues with the flow, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience.
            </li>
        </ol>
        In conclusion, the combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript facilitated the creation of an interactive
        and visually appealing choose-your-own-adventure game. The iterative development process and
        problem-solving approach contributed to a well-executed and engaging web-based game.
