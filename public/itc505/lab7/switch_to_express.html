          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            These instructions detail how to move from using the "http-server" package
            we have been using thus far to ExpressJS, a much more powerful and
            configurable web server.
          </p>

          <h2>Instructions</h2>
      
          <section>
            <h3> Restructuring your website folder </h3>
      
            <p>
              First, we need to rejigger the folder structure of your website a bit.
              These instructions assume that you keep all of the files and folders
              together in a single folder called "website" (or something like that)
              that you just periodically copy over to your server in order to update
              your live site.  If that's true, you can skip the next paragraph.
            </p>
      
            <p>
              If that's not the case, now's the time to start doing it that way.
              Luckily, everything is already arranged that way on your server, assuming
              that you've been doing the labs right, so just use FileZilla to copy
              your entire "website" folder from your server to your local machine.  Now
              you can just modify the files in that local folder and then update your
              live site by copying the entire folder over to your server and selecting
              "Overwrite" when conflicts arise.
            </p>
      
            <p>
              <strong>Before continuing, make a backup copy of your local "website"
                folder and keep it in a safe place!</strong>  That way, if something
              goes wrong (not that it's likely), you won't lose your work.
            </p>
      
            <p>
              <strong>On your local machine</strong>, enter into your "website" folder
              and create a new subfolder there called "public".  Then take all the
              other files and subfolders that are in your "website" folder and move
              them into "public".
            </p>
      
            <p>
              The only thing in your website folder should now be the "public" folder
              (with all your other stuff in it).
            </p>
      
            <p>
              Next, download the
              <a href="/downloads/server.js" download>
                express server configuration file
              </a>
              I created for you and put it in your "website" folder.
            </p>
      
            <p>
              You've done the last two steps correctly if "server.js" and "public" are
              the only two things in your "website" folder.

            <h3> Installing packages </h3>
      
            <p>
              Next, you will be installing several npm packages on both your local
              machine and your server:
            </p>
      
            <dl>
              <dt>express</dt>
              <dd>the new server package</dd>
      
              <dt>forever</dt>
              <dd>
                a package that allows you to start and restart your server more easily
              </dd>
      
              <dt>morgan</dt>
              <dd>improves the logging capability of express</dd>
            </dl>
      
            <p>
              To install these packages, <code>cd</code> into your website directory
              and execute the command <code>npm install express morgan</code> and
              then <code>npm install -g forever</code>.
            </p>
      
            <p>
              If you see some warning messages from NPM during the install
              process, that is fine!
            </p>
      
            <p>
              <strong>
                Don't forget to do this on both your development machine and your
                server!
              </strong>
            </p>
          </section>
      
          <section>
            <h3> Test the Express setup locally </h3>
      
            <p>
              Still on your local machine, run your new setup by opening a
              terminal/command-prompt, moving into your "website" folder, and issuing
              the following command:
            </p>
      
            <pre>node server.js local</pre>
      
            <p>
              Now open up your web browser and visit
              <a href="http://localhost:8080/cs212/lab/4" target="_blank">
                http://localhost:8080/cs212/lab/4
              </a>
              and make sure that you get the appropriate page.  Of course, if you
              didn't do lab four, you can visit some other page to verify things
              are working as they should be.
            </p>
      
            <p>
              Next visit
              <a href="http://localhost:8080/do_a_random" target="_blank">
                http://localhost:8080/do_a_random
              </a>.
              If you see a message with a random number displayed, then everything is
              working.  Awesome!  You're nearly done.
            </p>

            <h3> Transferring to your Hostwinds server </h3>
      
            <p>
              Now you just have to move everything to your hostwinds server and start
              up your new ExpressJS powered configuration.  To do so, follow these
              steps:
            </p>
      
            <ol>
              <li>
                SSH into your server
              </li>
      
              <ins>
                <li>
                  Execute the following commands so that node can find your globally
                  installed modules.  It is expected that neither of these commands will
                  produce visible output.
                  <pre class="code">echo "export NODE_PATH=$(npm list -g 2>/dev/null | head -n 1)/node_modules" >> ~/.bashrc</pre>
                  <pre class="code">source ~/.bashrc</pre>
                </li>
              </ins>
      
              <li>
                Kill the running "http-server" process by running the command
                <code>killall node http-server</code>
              </li>
      
              <li>
                Using either Filezilla or shell commands, delete the "website" folder
                <strong>on your server</strong>; this is so you don't end up with
                duplicates of all your pages in "website" (old configuration) and
                "website/public" (new configuration)
              </li>
      
              <li>
                Copy your local "website" folder onto your server using FileZilla
              </li>
      
              <li>
                In your SSH terminal/command-prompt that is connected to your server,
                <code>cd</code> into your "website" folder and execute the command
                <code>node server.js</code>
              </li>
      
              <li>
                Verify that your site and all your pages are accessible, especially the
                new page at
                <a>
                  http://&lt;your domain name&gt;/do_a_random
                </a>.
              </li>
      
              <li>
                Ok, that was just the test, so hit Ctrl+c to kill the server.
              </li>
      
              <li>
                Execute the command <code>forever start server.js</code>;  this will
                keep your server running after you close the SSH connection.
              </li>
              <li>
                Double-check that your site is up.  If it is, you're done!
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h3> Local dev </h3>
      
            <p>
              When you want to boot up your Express server for local development,
              just <code>cd</code> to your "website" folder and execute the command
              <code>node server.js local</code>.  You can then stop the server with
              Ctrl+c after that.

            <h3> When you need to restart Express on your server</h3>
      
            <p>
              Now that you've switched over to using Express with the "forever"
              package, restarting your server is really easy.  Just SSH in,
              <code>cd</code> to your "website" directory, and then execute the command
              <code>forever restart 0</code>.  Likewise, you can stop it with
              <code>forever stop 0</code>.
