            Creating this Lights Out game was a challenging yet rewarding journey. Initially, the biggest hurdle was
            simulating random clicks while maintaining a solvable configuration. To overcome this, I implemented a
            backtracking algorithm that verified the solvability after each simulated click, ensuring players always
            receive a playable board.
            <br><br>
            Another challenge was implementing the win condition. I initially attempted to track the number of squares
            turned off, but this proved cumbersome. To simplify this, I checked for either one or zero remaining
            squares, indicating victory.
            <br><br>
            Adding a click counter and scorecard enhanced the gameplay experience, allowing players to track their
            progress and aim for lower scores. Integrating these features involved creating additional variables and
            updating elements dynamically based on user actions.
            <br><br>
            Despite the challenges, this project helped me solidify my understanding of JavaScript concepts like event
            listeners, DOM manipulation, and backtracking algorithms. Additionally, it allowed me to experiment with
            creative elements like the pink color scheme and the scorecard, leading to a more engaging and customized
            game.
            <br><br>
            Overall, this project offered a valuable learning experience, fostering my problem-solving skills and
            ability to apply JavaScript concepts to create a functional and engaging game.
